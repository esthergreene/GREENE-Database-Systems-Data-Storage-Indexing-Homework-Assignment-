# GREENE-Database-Systems-Data-Storage-Indexing-Homework-Assignment-
Implement a Python-based storage system for variable-length records using the slotted-page structure as described in database systems theory. You will create a system that can store, retrieve, and manage records with variable-length fields within fixed-size pages.

# NOTES
This program is incomplete. The code was planned, thought out, built-- but it does not execute. I am unsure of the problem just yet, but I think it has something to do with the "recs" variable. Also, I have never used Python, so there are numerous references. Lots of research done.
